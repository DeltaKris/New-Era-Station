changes:
  - rscadd: Infiltrators have been ported from Hippiestation (again)
  - rscadd: Credits to Oraclestation (rip btw) and steamp0rt (for porting it to hippie
      in the first place)
  - rscadd: Infiltrators are stealth nuke ops that don't nuke. Cause a nuke isn't
      stealthy.
  - rscadd: Instead, they all have a couple of normal traitor objectives, and some
      new, more complex ones.
  - rscadd: And some cool new equipment like chameleon hardsuits.
  - rscadd: Because stealth. Don't be found! If you fail, the syndicate will be pretty
      bummed! (you'll be 'fired', syndicate style)
  - rscadd: 'Now, in relation to Hippie:'
  - rscadd: Admins can now add and edit infiltrator objectives (DO IT VIA THE TEAM
      PANEL OR ELSE THEY WON'T GET GREENTEXT)
  - rscadd: The syndicate cutter got some better lightning, and a surgical duffel
      bag instead of a bunch of surgery tools (and the lack of surgical drapes, for
      some reason)
  - bugfix: The AI doesn't turn dematerialize and turn invisible after being hijacked
  - bugfix: Did you know those chameleon hardsuits were always intended to look like
      sec hardsuits by default?
  - bugfix: Speaking of, the hardsuit helmets don't always look like engineering helmets
      anymore.
  - bugfix: They will still turn back to looking like engi helmets if you try to toggle
      their lights while disguised as a hardsuit without toggleable lights. So like,
      don't do that for now?
